# Raptor

Simple Java implementation of the [Raptor (Round-Based Public Transit Routing)](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/raptor_alenex.pdf) algorithm.

If you want to use this library you'll need to write implementations of the [data provider interfaces](https://github.com/raoulvdberge/raptor/tree/master/src/main/java/com/raoulvdberge/raptor/provider) that the `Raptor` class needs.

If you want examples on how to use this library, please check out [the tests](https://github.com/raoulvdberge/raptor/blob/master/src/test/java/com/raoulvdberge/raptor/RaptorTest.java).

Inspired by [Planar Network's TypeScript implementation](https://github.com/planarnetwork/raptor).
